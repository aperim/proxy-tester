# Proxy Tester ðŸš€

Welcome to Proxy Tester! Proxy Tester is written in TypeScript and Node.js and is primarily intended to assist in testing the intermediary proxies and their ability to pass HTTP status and other header information back to a client.

## Features

1. Handles every valid HTTP status code from 100-599 for testing.
2. For request `/<statuscode>`, responds with the corresponding status code, the type of the status code, client's IP and headers sent by the client.
3. For status codes in the 300 range, redirects to `/redirected/<statuscode>` and responds with client's IP and headers sent by the client.
4. Provides detailed debug logs for incoming request IPs and User-Agents.
5. Uses automated GitHub Actions Workflows to build and push docker images to GitHub Container Registry.
